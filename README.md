# Currency Converter

## Description

This webapp uses ExchangeRate-API to convert USD to other currency types.  First it takes an array of currency codes from the API and makes each element into a selector option.  When an amount is entered into the text field and the selector option is changed, another API is used to find the full name of the currency and the converted amount will be displayed.
